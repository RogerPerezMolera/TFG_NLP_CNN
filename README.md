# TFG_NLP_CNN
Repository with my Bachelor's degree final project. Natural Language Processing with Convolutional Neural Networks.

I will work with python to build a model for NLP with Convolutional Neural Networks. I am studying Statistics at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya in Barcelona. I am really interested in Artificial Intelligence, more concretely I enjoy playing around with Neural Networks.
